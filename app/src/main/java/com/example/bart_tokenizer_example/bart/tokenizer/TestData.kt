    val text4 = "Many parents believe that reading bedtime stories to their children every night helps improve their vocabulary and imagination. Studies have shown that kids who are read to regularly tend to perform better in school and develop stronger communication skills.

    val text5 = "Many researchers believe that the key to long-term learning lies not in the number of hours spent studying, but in the techniques used to retain and recall information effectively. By utilizing methods such as spaced repetition, active recall, and interleaved practice, students can significantly enhance their ability to understand complex topics and retain them for extended periods of time. Furthermore, creating meaningful connections between new information and existing knowledge can drastically improve memory consolidation and boost overall academic performance."
    val text6 = "많은 연구자들은 장기적인 학습의 핵심은 공부에 들인 시간보다 정보를 효과적으로 기억하고 회상하는 데 사용하는 기법에 달려 있다고 믿습니다. 간격 반복, 능동적 회상, 교차 연습과 같은 방법을 활용함으로써 학생들은 복잡한 주제를 이해하고 장기간 기억할 수 있는 능력을 크게 향상시킬 수 있습니다. 더 나아가 새로운 정보와 기존 지식 간의 의미 있는 연결을 만드는 것은 기억 고착을 크게 개선하고 전반적인 학업 성취도를 높일 수 있습니다."
